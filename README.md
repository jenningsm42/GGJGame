# GGJGame
This is our submission for Global Game Jam 2016 in Vancouver, BC. [Benjamin Lang](https://github.com/BenjaminLang) and I formed the team for this project.

## How To Play
Left click on a worker to select it. You can then click the icons on the top right section of the screen to select a tower, then click on a tile to build it. You can also right click a tile with a worker selected to move there. Press escape to exit.

The goal of the game is to defend the tribespeople performing the ritual in the middle for as long as possible.

## Dependencies
Our project was made in C++ using SFML 2.3.2 for the graphics processing. There are Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and Xcode project files included, the only extra required files should be the SFML 2.3.2 include and library files.

## Additional Information
Note that because this was a 48-hour event, there are many issues present. For instance, the second tower does not implement 'damage over time' properly.
